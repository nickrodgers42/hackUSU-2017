Hack USU 2017 project

This is the HackUSU 2017 project created by Nicholas Rodgers and Ashley Baugh in the time span of 36 straight hours. All of the media in the game was created by Ashley and Nick, mostly at the competition. The coding was done entirely at the competition. This project was written in Game Maker Studio 2, written using GML.

The premise for this game was a joke that we like to refer to as the "Monk Joke".
